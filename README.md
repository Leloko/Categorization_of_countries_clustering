# Categorization_of_countries_clustering
This report presents the solution to a clustering problem where socio-economic and health
data of different countries have been collected to determine underdeveloped countries that
need to be aided to fight poverty. Countries are divided into three clusters according to the
similarity of their socio-economic and health features. Data preparation processes that include
finding and removing null records and duplicated records, feature scaling are performed on the
data. Three clustering models: k-means clustering, agglomerative clustering, and Gaussian
mixture model (GMM) were applied and the prediction results were compared. The dataset can be found
on this link: [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rohan0301/unsupervised-learning-on-country-data). Using this dataset, countries are divided into three different categories
using their socio-economic and health features.
